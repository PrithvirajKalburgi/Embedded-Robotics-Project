# Embedded-Robotics-Project
The main goal behind this project is to make a functional robot hooked to the Arduino circuit board. The board is programmed with various different Robot functions such as moving forwards, backwards, 360 turns and also has a compass attached to it which reads directions. There is also an ISP connected to the board which allows the user to control the robot through a web page.
